# NumberGuessGame
This program utilizing Tkinter, presents an interactive game where users guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. Input is through an entry widget, and feedback is displayed in dynamic labels. A correct guess declares the player a "WINNER!!", while hints like "Little more!" or "Little less!" aid users.
